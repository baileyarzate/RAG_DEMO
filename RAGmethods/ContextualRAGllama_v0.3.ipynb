The CSEF has used the B-1B Engineering Research Simulator (ERS) as a major tool in these human-in-the-loop simulation studies. 1.2 Some examples of past efforts include the Defensive System Upgrade Program studies, Conventional Mission Upgrade Program studies, Block Upgrade studies, Crew Station Working Group support, a Link 16 Study, B-1B Blocks D, E, and F Baseline Study, and an Alternative Launch Acceptability Region Study. Government engineers have worked closely with the contractors, Boeing (B-1B), and L-3 Communications, Link Simulation and Training to support these efforts. The CSEF has helped fold these results back into the B-1B system to make it a safer and more effective system. 1.3 New smart weapons and advanced avionics systems have spurred the need for B-1B upgrades. The current B-1B Block D upgrade provides the B-1B the capability to carry up to 24 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). The JDAM tail kit turns a 2000-pound dumb bomb (e.g., Mark 84) into a global positioning system and inertial navigation system guided near precision weapon. This increase in weapon capabilities also increases mission complexity. Before Block D, the B-1B would drop multiple bombs on a single target area. Now the B-1B has the capability to direct individual weapons to individual target points. Since a JDAM is a guided weapon, the weapon launch point has expanded into a region. The launch acceptability region (LAR) is the area from which the JDAM must be launched by the B-1B in order to achieve the desired mean point of impact (DMPI). Mission complexity arises when multiple DMPIs are compressed in time and bomb runs are conducted in a threat environment. Further complexity is introduced due to the possibility of system malfunctions such as hung stores. This increased weapon and mission complexity may require upgraded controls and display technology so that the crew is not task saturated and retains situational awareness. 1 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE 2.1 The objective of this study was to conduct a human factors evaluation of a conceptual Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) compared to Head Down Displays (HDDs) in the JDAM/LAR environment. 2 3.0 METHOD 3.1 The CSEF’s B-1B ERS was used. All study participants flew from the pilot’s seat. A 4” X 4” color liquid crystal display (LCD) and an 8” X 6” color LCD, or HDDs, as well as a HMD were operational on the pilot’s side. See Appendix A for technical descriptions of the LCDs and HMD. See FIGURE 1 for the main instrument panel layout. Note that FIGURE 1 represents the Block D displays except for the LCDs. 3.1.1 HMD Head Tracker The HMD had a head tracker of the magnetic field type. The tracker determined the helmet, ground, and aircraft spatial relationships in pitch, roll, and yaw and moved the symbology within the HMD field of view accordingly. This process operated in real time. The tracker and HMD and the HMD combiner glass/eye relationships were calibrated before the HMD missions were flown. The ERS’s magnetic field was not mapped. Magnetic field mapping may aid tracker accuracy. 3.1.2 Symbology</td>\n",

Other aircraft hours range = 45 to 2430 13 5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Recommend that a HMD for the B-1B not be pursued further as mechanized herein. HDDs should be pursued. A god’s eye view of the world is preferable to a panoramic overlay on the world. There is a fundamental mismatch in trying to adapt a HMD, whose forte is the vertical situation, to rectify B-1B deficiencies in horizontal situational awareness. This mismatch may have safety implications such as disorientation and incorrect information interpretation. 5.2 Recommend that additional displays be made available in the front cockpit of the B- 1B. The Block D displays are unacceptable for JDAM missions where there is a possibility of the aircraft going off of the black line or planned route. This is directly related to unacceptable LAR and threat situational awareness up front. 5.3 Recommend that the displays should be integrated into the B-1B system, regardless of display type. For example, if integrated, the displays can provide critical LAR and threat information. If the displays are not integrated, they can only supply very limited information. 5.4 Recommend that if a HMD is pursued further, additional targeting (e.g., time-to- weapon release), perhaps different LAR formatting (e.g., LAR-in-the-sky), better vertical situation information (e.g., pitch ladder, velocity vector), and range to threat information should be explored. Also the HMD restricts the pilot’s ability to choose information input. This may restrict proper use of control instruments (e.g., VSD). This should also be explored. 5.5 Recommend that if HDDs are used, then they be located in the best possible cross- check location. The 4” X 4” HDD was preferred over the 8” X 6” HDD because of its better location in the main instrument panel (see FIGURE 1). This made for easier instrument cross-checks and transitions from head down to head up. 14 APPENDIX A: DISPLAY TECHNICAL DESCRIPTIONS A.1 Rockwell Collins 4” x 4” (FDS-255): Color Active Matrix LCD 4.22” x 4.22” Viewable Area Box = 5.08”H x 5.08”W x 8.75” D RS-170 video (525 lines) 64 Shades of Grey, 256 Symbol Colors NVIS Compatible Viewing Angle +/- 650H, +400/-200V A.2 Computer Dynamics 8” x 6” (SH23): Color Active Matrix LCD Glass made by Lucky Gold Star 8.3”W x 6.2”H Viewable Area Box = 8.6”H x 12.6”W x 3.5”D For this study RS-170 video (525 lines) 64 Shades of Grey 256 Colors Viewing Angle +/-400H, +100/-300V A.3 Kaiser SIM EYETM 40 HMD (as used in this study)</td>\n",

Having a ground depiction of JDAM footprint that has to be dragged over a DMPI requires too much heads down looking. Found myself looking at HIS + control stick! Maybe consider upside-down wedding cake for LAR depiction so my head would be more level at my altitude. It would have been perfect but it still does not provide steering information to a fixed LAR which would exist with an azimuth constrained JDAM. • Really liked seeing the footprint of where we can send a JDAM. • Concept works well – LAR display needs to be higher in field of view. • Good SA 25 11.

Use the following scale: 7 Totally Acceptable 6 Very Acceptable 5 Somewhat Acceptable 4 Borderline 3 Somewhat Unacceptable 2 Very Unacceptable 1 Totally Unacceptable Ratings: 1 5 3 1 RATING: Average: 5.4 Comments: • Interesting dilemma. Adds the nav info that was missing in the 6x8 but symbology is not as intuitive. Also solves readability from left vs. right seat (i.e. N/A). Is it NVG compatible? Too much looking between VSD and HMD. Symbology is too small at the top and not all-inclusive (i.e. the navigation). The weight and overall cumbersome fit will be a fatigue issue. If properly done, a HMD would be very beneficial for both JDAM releases and threat avoidance! Consider God’s eye + fly-through graphics options instead of current design. Goal is to reduce head movement – not to increase it! (Very difficult to see plus ID threats at 3+9 o’clock.) This is a giant leap forward in improving the SA of the pilots in the B-1B. This should allow B-1B pilots to fly with their heads up instead of trying to figure out navigation and target steering from HDDs in the cockpit. It’s tougher to fly the airplane and look through the HMD, but it provides incredible SA on target, footprint, and threat location. Need to combine with an NVG image for night operations. • I think with some improvements in the size of the device, clarity of the image and proper training that this could be a useful device. From a training point of view it would be more difficult to teach a guy how to use this compared to just looking at the God’s eye view LCD. It was more difficult to include crosscheck than LCD. Good – no major problems – would require additional training time – not as intuitive as flat screen, 26 SECTION 2 – 4” X 4” HDD 12.

The CSEF has used the B-1B Engineering Research Simulator (ERS) as a major tool in these human-in-the-loop simulation studies. 1.2 Some examples of past efforts include the Defensive System Upgrade Program studies, Conventional Mission Upgrade Program studies, Block Upgrade studies, Crew Station Working Group support, a Link 16 Study, B-1B Blocks D, E, and F Baseline Study, and an Alternative Launch Acceptability Region Study. Government engineers have worked closely with the contractors, Boeing (B-1B), and L-3 Communications, Link Simulation and Training to support these efforts. The CSEF has helped fold these results back into the B-1B system to make it a safer and more effective system. 1.3 New smart weapons and advanced avionics systems have spurred the need for B-1B upgrades. The current B-1B Block D upgrade provides the B-1B the capability to carry up to 24 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). The JDAM tail kit turns a 2000-pound dumb bomb (e.g., Mark 84) into a global positioning system and inertial navigation system guided near precision weapon. This increase in weapon capabilities also increases mission complexity. Before Block D, the B-1B would drop multiple bombs on a single target area. Now the B-1B has the capability to direct individual weapons to individual target points. Since a JDAM is a guided weapon, the weapon launch point has expanded into a region. The launch acceptability region (LAR) is the area from which the JDAM must be launched by the B-1B in order to achieve the desired mean point of impact (DMPI). Mission complexity arises when multiple DMPIs are compressed in time and bomb runs are conducted in a threat environment. Further complexity is introduced due to the possibility of system malfunctions such as hung stores. This increased weapon and mission complexity may require upgraded controls and display technology so that the crew is not task saturated and retains situational awareness. 1 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE 2.1 The objective of this study was to conduct a human factors evaluation of a conceptual Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) compared to Head Down Displays (HDDs) in the JDAM/LAR environment. 2 3.0 METHOD 3.1 The CSEF’s B-1B ERS was used. All study participants flew from the pilot’s seat. A 4” X 4” color liquid crystal display (LCD) and an 8” X 6” color LCD, or HDDs, as well as a HMD were operational on the pilot’s side. See Appendix A for technical descriptions of the LCDs and HMD. See FIGURE 1 for the main instrument panel layout. Note that FIGURE 1 represents the Block D displays except for the LCDs. 3.1.1 HMD Head Tracker The HMD had a head tracker of the magnetic field type. The tracker determined the helmet, ground, and aircraft spatial relationships in pitch, roll, and yaw and moved the symbology within the HMD field of view accordingly. This process operated in real time. The tracker and HMD and the HMD combiner glass/eye relationships were calibrated before the HMD missions were flown. The ERS’s magnetic field was not mapped. Magnetic field mapping may aid tracker accuracy. 3.1.2 Symbology</td>\n",
